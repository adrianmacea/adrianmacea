ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Adrian Macea.

I am a self-taught, enthusiastic web developer with extensive experience in graphic design. 

My developer journey began in September 2020 and I have been actively expanding my web developer skills ever since. Currently, Iâ€™m learning and practicing TypeScript and Sass. 

I love boardgames, music and learning new things.
